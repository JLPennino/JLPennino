- 👋 Hi, I’m @JLPennino
- 👀 I’m interested in everything technology! However, I'm most passionate about venturing into the IoT within my future career and changing the world, one step at a time. 
- 🌱 I’m currently studying a Computer Science Degree at University and start my Second Year in September!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on absolutely anything, I'm always down to attempt things I've never tried or learnt before. 
- 📫 You can get in contact with me via email at jamyep@sky.com many thanks!
